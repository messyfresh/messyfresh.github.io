    <h1>Embedded systems that survive real networks and audits</h1>
    <p>
      I work across QNX and embedded Linux systems from board bring-up through deployment,
      keeping firmware, networking, and compliance decisions aligned for regulated devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work covers enterprise Wi-Fi, structured device-to-cloud protocols, manufacturing
      diagnostics, and cybersecurity documentation that has to stand up in customer and
      regulatory reviews.
    </p>

    <h2>Work I take on</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designing communication paths for long-lived devices, pairing deterministic retry
        behavior with TLS authentication so devices stay reachable inside noisy hospital
        networks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Building manufacturing test firmware and on-device tooling that capture logs, expose
        health metrics, and let field teams recover hardware after failed updates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Owning cybersecurity compliance artifacts: SBOM/CBOM production, certificate and key
        provisioning flows, and vulnerability intake that links directly to engineering fixes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I approach systems</h2>
    <p>
      I treat software, RF realities, and compliance evidence as a single system. Decisions
      about kernel configuration or logging impact how quickly we can triage controller
      alarms and how convincing our audit story will be a year later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tooling and automation matter because teams repeat the same workflows across releases.
      I rely on Python and shell to turn manual validation or certificate rotation steps into
      reproducible processes so we can prove what happened and when.
    </p>

    <h2>Networking and field reality</h2>
    <p>
      Most issues show up only after devices hit congested Wi-Fi and constrained backhaul.
      I work directly with Cisco controller traces, packet captures, and QoS settings to keep
      devices authenticated and visible when RF conditions shift.
    </p>
    <p>
      When something fails, the priority is building diagnostics that frontline teams can run
      without me. Reliable artifacts, not heroics, keep fleets operating.
    </p>

    <h2>Leadership grounded in service</h2>
    <p>
      I spent a decade in the U.S. Army and left as a Staff Sergeant after seven years running
      networks and three years as a recruiter. Those roles set my bar for accountability and
      taught me to keep teams moving with clear procedures, not slogans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recruiting tour sharpened communication and interviewing skills, which I now apply to
      technical debates, stakeholder updates, and mentoring. I am looking for engineering
      leadership roles where calm incident response, direct communication, and documented
      reasoning are valued.
